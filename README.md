This repository demonstrates a common SQL error: using a reserved keyword as a column alias in a SELECT statement. The `bug.sql` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.sql` provides the corrected version. The error arises because SQL dialects often have keywords with pre-defined meanings, and attempting to use them as identifiers (like column names or aliases) will generally produce a syntax error.  The solution involves using alternative names that aren't reserved keywords, or quoting the identifier to escape the keyword's special meaning.
